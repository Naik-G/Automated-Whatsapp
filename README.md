# Automated Whatsapp

After I sleep, many a times some of my close friends whatsapp me regarding some work expecting that I'm awake and will reply soon(which ain't possible for sure). Thus, I made this whatsapp bot in PYTHON 3.x which tells your closed friends that you're sleeping and will reply as soon as you get up!

## Requirements
Python 3.x with selenium installed

**Install Python from here:** https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Install Selenium Using command:** pip install selenium

## How to use the bot?

1. Run the code.
2. The code will automatically open Whatsapp Web in Chrome where you're supposed to scan the QR code.
3. Sleep Well! :)
